One day, Jack’s mother told him to sell their only cow. Jack went to the market and on the way he met a man who wanted to buy his cow. Jack asked, "What will you give me in return for my cow?" The man answered, "I will give you five magic beans!" Jack took the magic beans and gave the man the cow. But when he reached home, Jack’s mother was very angry. She said, "You fool! He took away your cow and gave you some beans!" She threw the beans out of the window.'}],id:2065}],id:11},{title:"Aula 011 - Fundação",description:"",videoUrl:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tOE9No89hM0?si=mrQ5bfKcxGzVhRm8",duration:"",order:"11",files:[{title:"Jack and the Beanstalk 02",description:"",fileUrl:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XyOa15tL9xmb92LBwluYOaNoH-CI5q8l/preview",type:"pdf",id:1019},{title:"Jack and the Beanstalk 03",description:"",fileUrl:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yaABtJC1PK1GAT2EyOGGTo76XSWCJPsN/preview",type:"pdf",id:1020},{title:"Jack and the Beanstalk 04",description:"",fileUrl:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/18EzzQUkVrDO-Ced7jzwKOIl0aph_NxAL/preview",type:"pdf",id:1021},{title:"Jack and the Beanstalk 05",description:"",fileUrl:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WLDr02ZnKevafYzP-0uon5z-b6khsa4F/preview",type:"pdf",id:1022},{title:"Jack and the Beanstalk 06",description:"",fileUrl:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RJII2b4kDSlgfWcm2IDakB1heZN-9qJ_/preview",type:"pdf",id:1023},{title:"Jack and the Beanstalk Completo",description:"",fileUrl:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S8ZK6sBQrUxrHE-vRqQnfaYEbhzz9MKT/preview",type:"pdf",id:1024}],audios:[{title:"Back and the Beanstalk 02 - Zoe",description:"",audioUrl:"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/8n9hggyxwgr3eu9zbuq7t/AUDIO-Jack-and-the-Beanstalk-02-Zoe.mp3?rlkey=belzbjiqedh1xtjy0iqsdh4yv&st=k95s5v07",transcript:[{time:0,text:'Jack was very sad and went to sleep without dinner.
