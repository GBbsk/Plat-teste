Jack went to the market and on the way he met a man who wanted to buy his cow. Jack asked, \"What will you give me in return for my cow?\" The man answered, \"I will give you five magic beans!\" Jack took the magic beans and gave the man the cow. But when he reached home, Jack’s mother was very angry. She said, \"You fool! He took away your cow and gave you some beans!\" She threw the beans out of the window."
