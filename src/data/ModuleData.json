Jack asked, \"What will you give me in return for my cow?\" The man answered, \"I will give you five magic beans!\" Jack took the magic beans and gave the man the cow. But when he reached home, Jack’s mother was very angry. She said, \"You fool! He took away your cow and gave you some beans!\" She threw the beans out of the window."

Determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber. First, she tried to lay on the big bed, but it was too high. Then, she tried to lay on the medium-sized bed, but it was too low. Finally, she tried the Little Bear’s bed, and it was just right. She covered herself up comfortably and fell asleep. By this time, the three bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat, so they came home for breakfast."

He took after his mother, with deep brown hair and eyes and olive-toned skin.

Zack, a five-year-old, was more like his father with strawberry-blonde hair and a pale complexion. He was also more like his father in his love for mischief. His father enjoyed hiding around corners and popping out at the next passer-by, saying, \"Boo!\" and startling them. Zack also loved to hide and surprise people, but he had other added mischievous behaviors, as well."

Zack, a five-year-old, was more like his father with strawberry-blonde hair and a pale complexion. He was also more like his father in his love for mischief. His father enjoyed hiding around corners and popping out at the next passer-by, saying, \"Boo!\" and startling them. Zack also loved to hide and surprise people, but he had other added mischievous behaviors, as well."

He began calling their names, trying to get them to come out of hiding. When this didn't work, he tried searching around the campsite, but he couldn't find any sign of them. Beginning to panic, he called his wife and together they called the park rangers. Soon, every available person in the campground was getting organized in a search pattern beginning at the Jenson's campsite. Both Jensons were determined to help in the search, although they struggled to control their panic enough to listen to directions. Soon, the woods were filled with the voices of rangers and volunteer searchers calling, \"William? Zack?\" After a few hours with no sign of the boys, the rangers called in their \"secret weapon.\" An hour later, a man named Chuck arrived with a droopy, drooling, red-eyed old bloodhound. \"This here's Rufus,\" Chuck told the Jensons. \"He may look a mess, but he can track a scent for miles. Just get me something that smells like your boys.\""

He had run out of mischief, and all he felt now was fear. \"Of course not,\" said William. \"I just want to be careful just in case. I know mom and dad started looking for us as soon as you ran off. They'll probably be here before morning.\" \"It's gonna get really dark, isn't it?\" \"Maybe. But it'll be okay. We'll see all the stars. And we have your flashlight.\" William put his arm around his little brother. He felt scared, too, but he knew that he had to act brave or Zack would get even more afraid. \"I'm really tired, but I don't think I can sleep,\" said Zack. \"How about I read to you?\" William asked. \"I don't like books with no pictures.\" \"I know. That's why it might help you sleep.\" \"Oh. Okay.\""

Truth be told, I never graduated from college and this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I wanna tell you three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories. The first story is about connecting the dots. I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out? It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl."

My biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college. This was the start in my life. And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working- class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition."

And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting. It wasn’t all romantic. I didn’t have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends’ rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5 cent deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on."

Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn’t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and sans serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating. None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography."

And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on that calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later. Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something, your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well-worn path, and that will make all the difference."

We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We'd just released our finest creation, the Macintosh, a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first years or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. And so at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating."

I felt that I'd let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down (let down), that I'd dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the Valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me: I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I'd been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over. I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life. During the next five years I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife."

In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, and I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together. I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful-tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life is gonna hit you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is gonna fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking, and don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking. Don't settle."

When I was 17 (seventeen), I read a quote that went something like: If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right. It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 (thirty-three) years, I've looked into the mirror every morning and asked myself: If today were the last day of my life would I wanna do what I am about to do today? And whenever the answer has been \"No\" for too many days in a row I know I need to change something. Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything, all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure, these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart."

The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months.

Later that evening I had a biopsy, Mais tarde naquela noite eu fiz uma biópsia, where they stuck an endoscope down to my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now. This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept. No one wants to die."

Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true. Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice.And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.They somehow already know what you truly want to become.Everything else is secondary."

It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age.On the back cover of their final issue, was a photograph of an early morning country road,the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous.Beneath it were the words:\"Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.\" It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself.And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.Thank you all very much."

It felt odd, but nice, this warmth and joy. He'd forgotten this feeling since Debbie left. He scooped up the pup, and it transferred the joyful licks to his face. Matthew said, \"I'll call you Kirk.\" He had decided to keep the puppy without even thinking about it. \"And you're going to make me late for work, again.\""

She had a photo of a fat beagle tacked to her cubicle wall, and shortly after getting Kirk, Matthew was able to start a conversation with her about dogs. They shared stories about their canine companions, and started to form a friendship. Matthew even thought sometimes that she might be flirting with him. In the evenings, Matthew still ate dinner and watched television, but he didn't feel as hungry, and his portion sizes lessened. He also had to take at least one or two more walks for Kirk to use the restroom, adding activity to Matthew's formerly sedentary evenings. And Matthew envisioned soon involving Jolene in some of his evenings – asking her over for dinner, cooking something she'd find impressive, and maybe walking their dogs together. Before he found Kirk scrounging for food in the garbage, none of this would have seemed possible. Somehow, this one small change had rearranged an entire life. As he settled in to sleep, Matthew practiced his intended question for the following day: \"So, Jolene, Kirk and I were wondering if you and Patches might join us for dinner at my place…\""

They declared they caught colds and sneezed more often, than in the times gone by. But the greatest objection that the old folks had to the chimneys was that robbers used them to climb down at night and steal people's money, when they were asleep. In Montgomery, which is one of the Welsh shires, the most famous of the robber gangs were called the Red Bandits. A young widow lived there, whose husband had been killed by road robbers. She was left alone in the world, with a little baby boy in the cradle and only one cow in the shed. She had to work hard to pay her rent, but as there were three or four scythes set in the chimney, and the cow stable had a good lock on it, she thought she was safe from burglars."

In Montgomery, which is one of the Welsh shires, the most famous of the robber gangs were called the Red Bandits. A young widow lived there, whose husband had been killed by road robbers. She was left alone in the world, with a little baby boy in the cradle and only one cow in the shed. She had to work hard to pay her rent, but as there were three or four scythes set in the chimney, and the cow stable had a good lock on it, she thought she was safe from burglars."

In the middle of this open space, was a ring of grass. In the ring a little fairy lady was tripping around and singing to herself. Creeping up silently, the anxious mother caught the sound of a name, several times repeated. It sounded like \"Silly Doot.\" She hurried home and set about her regular work and daily tasks.
